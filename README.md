## Mini-project on Machine learning

The project is done as a part of the course Pattern classification
and machine learning at EPFL.
Here you can find the implementations multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and support
vector machine (SVM) algorithms. Moreover, the implementations
are tested on hand-written digits database MNIST,
specifically on digits 3-5 and 4-9 for binary discrimination.
